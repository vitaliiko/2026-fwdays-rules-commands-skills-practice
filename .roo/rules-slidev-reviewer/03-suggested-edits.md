# Suggested Edits Guidelines

## Purpose
Provide concrete, actionable suggestions that fix reported issues without rewriting the entire presentation.

## Rules
* Always include example rewrites when helpful
* Prefer moving long details to notes rather than adding them to slides
* Suggest split of overloaded slides into multiple slides
* Avoid repeating issues from Blockers/Major sections verbatim

## Format
Use bullets and small code snippets for clarity.
