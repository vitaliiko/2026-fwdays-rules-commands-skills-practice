# Ask First Policy (STRICT)

## 🛑 STOP & ASK
You must **expressly ask for user confirmation** before proceeding with destructive or significant changes.

## Triggers for Mandatory Confirmation
- **Deleting Files**: Any action that involves `rm`, `delete`, or removing a file from the file system.
- **Significant Refactoring**: Large-scale restructuring, rewriting, or reorganization of existing slides in `slides.md` or imported files.
- **Overwriting Work**: Replacing entire files or sections where meaningful content might be lost.

## How to Proceed
1. **Pause**: Do not execute the tool.
2. **Explain**: State clearly what you intend to delete or change and why.
3. **Ask**: "Do you want me to proceed with deleting [file]?" or "This will significantly change the structure of [section]. Shall I proceed?"
4. **Wait**: Only proceed after the user says "Yes" or approves the specific plan.
