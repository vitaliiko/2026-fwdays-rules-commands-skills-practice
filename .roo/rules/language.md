# Language Policy

- **Technical Exceptions**: Use **English** for:
  - Code snippets and syntax
  - CLI commands and flags
  - File names and paths
  - Script names and configuration values
  - Technical terms where translation would reduce clarity
- **Context**: The Ukrainian requirement applies to titles, body text, bullet points, and speaker notes.
