# General Principles

- Use **Mermaid syntax only** — no pseudo-code or explanations inside the diagram.
- Every diagram must be **syntactically valid** and render without errors.
- Prefer **clarity over completeness**: diagrams should explain structure and flow, not every detail.
- One diagram = **one main idea**.
