# Presentation Best Practices: Narrative & Flow

## Story Arc
- **Structure**: Problem → Insight → Solution → Impact (or similar logical flow).
- **Continuity**: Each slide must answer "Why is the next slide necessary?".

## Engagement
- **Techniques**: Use contrast (before/after), visual progression, and reveals.
- **Avoid**: Over-animation, gimmicks, diagrams that are too dense early on.

## Charts
- **Simplicity**: One insight per chart. Remove non-essential gridlines and legends.
- **Labels**: Axis labels and units are mandatory.
- **Title**: Chart title must explain *what the chart proves*.
