# Presentation Best Practices: Core Principles

## One Slide = One Idea
- **Focus**: Every slide must communicate exactly one key message.
- **Split**: If there's more than one message, split the slide.
- **Concept**: Slides are billboards, not pages.

## Support, Don't Replace
- **Content**: No paragraphs, full explanations, or narration text.
- **Role**: The slide shows the **what**, the speaker explains the **why/how**.

## Cognitive Load
- **Brevity**: Fewer words > more clarity.
- **Space**: White space is a feature, not wasted space.
- **Simplicity**: If the slide feels "busy", it is wrong.
