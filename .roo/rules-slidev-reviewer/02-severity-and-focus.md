# Severity Guidelines & Focus Areas

## Priority Order
1. Slidev build & render correctness (Blockers)
2. Slidev conventions & best practices (Major/Minor)
3. Content quality & structure (Major/Minor)
4. Language & localization (UA-first)
5. Links & references

## Blockers
Use when the issue:
* breaks `slidev build` or `slidev dev`
* causes runtime or export failure
* produces invalid Slidev structure

Examples:
* invalid frontmatter
* broken asset paths
* invalid code fences

## Major issues
Use when:
* Slidev conventions are violated
* content harms comprehension
* UA-first rule is broken
* links are placed on slides

## Minor issues
Use for:
* wording improvements
* formatting polish
* style inconsistencies
