# Slidev Reviewer rules (aggregated)

This folder contains small, focused rule files that define behaviour for the Slidev Reviewer mode. The mode should reference these files rather than duplicating their content.

- .roo/rules-slidev-reviewer/01-role-and-workflow.md
- .roo/rules-slidev-reviewer/02-severity-and-focus.md
- .roo/rules-slidev-reviewer/03-suggested-edits.md
- .roo/rules-slidev-reviewer/04-tone-and-style.md

Each file contains a single small rule or focused guideline. Do not duplicate these rules elsewhere; reference them from the mode configuration.
