# Presentation Best Practices: Speaker Notes

## Mandatory Inclusion
- **Requirement**: Every single slide MUST exhibit comprehensive speaker notes.
- **Absence**: A slide without notes is incomplete and unacceptable.

## Content Quality
- **Role**: Notes act as the script or detailed guide. They explain the slide's visual "headline".
- **Detail**: Provide enough context, data, and backing points so a substitute speaker could present confidently.
- **Structure**:
  - **Hook**: Opening sentence to grab attention.
  - **Key Points**: 3-5 bullet points expanding on the slide visuals.
  - **Transition**: A closing sentence leading to the next slide.

## formatting
- **Format**: Use Markdown list format for readability.
- **Language**: Notes must follow the project's language policy (Ukrainian) unless specified otherwise.
