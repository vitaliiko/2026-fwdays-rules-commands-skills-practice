# Diagram Type

- Select the diagram type based on intent:
  - `flowchart` — processes, workflows, decision trees
  - `sequenceDiagram` — interactions over time (APIs, agents, services)
  - `classDiagram` — classes, interfaces, entities, relationships
  - `stateDiagram-v2` — states and transitions
  - `erDiagram` — databases and data models
  - `gantt` — timelines and scheduling
  - `mindmap` — conceptual structure (high-level only)
- Never mix concerns across diagram types.
